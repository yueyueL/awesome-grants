# Research Project Grants

**14 funding opportunities**

*Funding for specific research projects, often supporting teams, equipment, and multi-year investigations.*

---

## Overview

Research project grants support specific research questions and programs. Unlike fellowships (which fund individuals), project grants focus on the research itself and can support entire teams, equipment, and infrastructure.

### Key Features
- **Amount**: Typically $400,000 - $10+ million
- **Duration**: Usually 3-7 years
- **Support**: Personnel, equipment, supplies, travel
- **Scope**: Single-investigator to large collaborations
- **Audience**: Primarily faculty/PIs, some for postdocs

## Application Strategy

### Timeline
- **12-18 months before**: Develop research plan, gather preliminary data
- **6-12 months before**: Write full proposal, get internal review
- **3-6 months before**: Finalize budget, get letters of support
- **Submission**: Often requires institutional approval process

### Key Components

**Research Plan**
- Significance and innovation
- Preliminary results
- Detailed methodology
- Timeline and milestones
- Expected outcomes and impact

**Team & Resources**
- PI qualifications and track record
- Team composition and expertise
- Facilities and equipment
- Institutional support

**Budget Justification**
- Personnel costs (salaries, benefits)
- Equipment and supplies
- Travel and conferences
- Other direct costs
- Indirect costs (overhead)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Overly ambitious scope
- Insufficient preliminary data
- Unclear methodology
- Weak connection to funder priorities
- Budget inconsistent with aims
- Missing broader impacts (NSF)

## Success Rates & Competition

### Typical Award Rates
- **NSF CAREER**: ~20-25%
- **NIH R01**: ~20%
