# Researchers with Disabilities

**Unique funding model: Federal supplements enhance existing grants + direct scholarships**

Support available through two distinct pathways: federal agencies supplement existing awards to accommodate researchers with disabilities, while direct scholarships provide independent funding for students and early-career researchers.

---

## 📊 Overview

- **Two Funding Models**: Supplements (enhance existing grants) + Direct Scholarships (standalone)
- **Coverage**: All career stages (undergrad → faculty)
- **Funding Range**: $1,000 - $60,000+
- **Federal Support**: NIH and NSF lead with accommodation-focused programs
- **Key Insight**: Supplements don't compete with direct scholarships—apply to both

---

## 💡 Application Strategy

### Understanding the Two-Track System

**Federal Supplements (NIH, NSF):**
- These are NOT competitive with direct scholarships
- Require an existing grant (yours or your PI's)
- Focus on accommodations, not general support
- Apply if you need adaptive equipment or personnel

**Direct Scholarships:**
- Standalone competitive awards
- Can be used for tuition, living expenses, research
- Apply directly as a student or early-career researcher

### Recommended Approach

**For Students:**
1. Apply to **direct scholarships first** (Google Lime, NFB, ACB, FSD)
2. If working in a funded lab, ask PI about **NIH/NSF supplements**
3. Target disability-specific AND broader diversity programs (e.g., Microsoft)

**For Faculty/Postdocs:**
1. If you have NIH/NSF funding, request a **supplement** for accommodations
2. If studying disability issues, apply for **Switzer Fellowship**
3. Encourage students with disabilities to apply for supplements to your grants

**For Blind/Visually Impaired Students:**
- **NFB** and **ACB** are must-apply programs (30+ awards annually)
- Both organizations offer strong community and networking beyond funding

**For Computing Students:**
- **Google Lime** is the flagship opportunity ($10K + scholar retreat)
- **Microsoft Dissertation Grant** for PhD students ($25K)
