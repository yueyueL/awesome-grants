# International D&I Programs

Select diversity and inclusion programs outside the United States.

---

## 🌍 Overview

While the majority of D&I funding in this repository focuses on U.S.-based opportunities, several major international programs demonstrate global trends in diversity funding.

**Covered Regions:**
- 🇪🇺 European Union
- 🇬🇧 United Kingdom
- 🌏 Global South / Developing Countries

## European & UK Programs

### [European Research Council (ERC) - Gender and Diversity](https://erc.europa.eu/)

**Organization**: European Research Council
**Type**: Policy Framework
**Target**: All ERC-funded research

**Focus Areas:**
- Gender balance among applicants and reviewers
- Participation from Europe's less research-performing regions
- Inclusive research environments

**What This Means**: High-level policy commitment embedded across all ERC programs (Starting Grants, Consolidator Grants, Advanced Grants).

**For Researchers**: ERC grants in the main repository have built-in D&I commitments. See [EU Grants](../../regions/eu/README.md).

---

### [UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) - EDI Hub+](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/browse-our-areas-of-investment-and-support/equality-diversity-and-inclusion-hub/)

**Organization**: UK Research and Innovation
**Type**: Programmatic Funding
**Target**: Underrepresented groups, especially Black, Asian, and minority ethnic researchers

**Programs:**
- Initiatives to remove barriers to doctoral study
- Leadership development for underrepresented groups
- Data-driven analysis of ethnic and racial representation in funding

**For Researchers**: UKRI actively funds projects to improve access for minority ethnic students in higher education.

### [Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) - LGBT+ Inclusion Grant](https://www.rsc.org/funding-and-support/funding/lgbt-inclusion-in-stem-grant)

**Organization**: Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)
**Amount**: Varies
**Deadline**: Rolling
**Eligibility**: Researchers in the UK studying LGBT+ attrition/retention in STEM

**Purpose**: Funds pilot research studies investigating why LGBT+ individuals leave STEM fields and how to improve retention.

**Significance**: Demonstrates commitment to data-driven inclusion. A model for evidence-based D&I work.

## Global Programs

### [L'Oréal-UNESCO International Awards](https://www.forwomeninscience.com/)

**Organization**: L'Oréal Foundation & UNESCO
**Amount**: €100,000 per award
**Deadline**: Varies by region
**Eligibility**: Eminent women scientists (one per global region)

**Awards Given To:**
- One outstanding woman scientist from each of five world regions:
  - Africa & Arab States
  - Asia & Pacific
  - Europe
  - Latin America
  - North America

**Additional Program**: "International Rising Talents" - recognizes early-career women scientists globally.

**Significance**: Premier global recognition for women in science. Highly prestigious.

**Also see**: [L'Oréal USA FWIS Fellowship](../women-in-stem/README.md) for U.S.-based postdocs.

### [Organization for Women in Science (OWSD) Early Career Fellowship](https://owsd.net/early-career-fellowship)

**Organization**: Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD)
**Amount**: $50,000
**Deadline**: Varies
**Eligibility**: Women PhDs in Science and Technology Lagging Countries (STLCs)

**Target**: Women researchers who have completed PhDs in STEM and are employed at academic institutions in developing countries.

**Eligible Countries**: Designated "Science and Technology Lagging Countries (STLCs)" - primarily in:
- Sub-Saharan Africa
- South Asia
- Southeast Asia
- Latin America

**Purpose**: Support women scientists in countries with limited research infrastructure to continue their research careers.

## 🌐 Global Trends in D&I Funding

### 1. Policy Integration
European programs (ERC, UKRI) integrate D&I into **all** funding, rather than creating separate diversity grants.

### 2. Evidence-Based Approach
Programs like RSC LGBT+ Inclusion Grant fund **research on diversity** itself, using data to drive policy.

### 3. Regional Equity
OWSD and L'Oréal-UNESCO explicitly address geographic inequities, supporting researchers in under-resourced regions.

### 4. Intersectional Recognition
UKRI's focus on "Black, Asian, and minority ethnic" researchers alongside other dimensions shows intersectional thinking similar to U.S. trends.
