# Institutional D&I Programs - Strategic Guide

**Large-scale programmatic grants awarded to universities, not individuals**

This is a **strategic resource** for identifying universities and departments with funded commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

---

## ⚠️ Important: How to Use This Section

**You cannot apply directly to these programs.**

These are institutional grants where:
1. A **university or college** receives the award
2. The institution uses funds to create **internal support programs**
3. Researchers benefit through institutional fellowships, mentorship, and resources

**Your Strategy**: Use this list to identify universities that have demonstrated, funded commitments to supporting researchers from your background.

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

A university with one of these grants has:
- ✅ **Dedicated funding** for D&I support
- ✅ **Internal fellowships** you can apply for as a student/faculty
- ✅ **Mentorship programs** specifically for underrepresented researchers
- ✅ **Institutional infrastructure** supporting your success
- ✅ **Proven commitment** (not just a diversity statement)
