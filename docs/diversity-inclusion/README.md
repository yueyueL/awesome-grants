## 🔑 Understanding D&I Funding Models

**Two Primary Models:**

### 1. Direct Individual Support
Traditional fellowships and scholarships where individuals apply directly:
- **Examples**: AAUW Fellowships, Point Foundation, NFB Scholarships
- **Strategy**: Browse categories above and apply directly

### 2. Institutional & Programmatic Grants
Large awards to universities that create internal support programs:
- **Examples**: Clare Boothe Luce Program, NASA MUREP, McNair Scholars
- **Strategy**: Identify universities with these grants for supportive environments

## 📊 Funding Landscape Overview

### Three Pillars of D&I Funding

**1. Federal Agencies**
- **NSF** - Broadening Participation programs
- **NIH** - Diversity Supplements
- **NASA** - MUREP, MOSAICS
- **DOE** - DEI Requirements

**2. Private Foundations**
- **AAUW** - Women's education (since 1888)
- **L'Oréal-UNESCO** - Women in Science
- **Point Foundation** - LGBTQ+ scholars
- **Robert Wood Johnson Foundation** - Health equity

**3. Professional & Corporate**
- **IEEE** - Women in Engineering
- **oSTEM** - LGBTQ+ in STEM
- **Google** - Lime Scholarship (disability)
- **Microsoft** - Research Dissertation Grants

## ✨ Key Trends in D&I Funding

### Intersectional Approach
Modern grants increasingly recognize multiple identities:
- Ford Foundation Fellowships
- RWJF New Connections ($50,000)
- W.T. Grant Foundation programs
- Microsoft Research Dissertation Grant

### Resource Distribution

**🌟 Well-Funded (Oasis):**
- **Women in STEM** - Robust support at all career stages

**🏜️ Resource Gaps (Desert):**
- **First-Generation** - Primarily institutional support (McNair)
- **Disability** - Fewer direct fellowships; mainly supplements/accommodations
