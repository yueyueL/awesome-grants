# First-Generation & Low-Income (FGLI) Scholars

**Institutional vs. Intersectional: McNair Programs dominate, but intersectional funding offers larger awards**

Support for first-generation college students and those from low-income backgrounds operates through two channels: university-based McNair programs provide structured pathways to PhD programs, while intersectional funding recognizes FGLI status alongside other identities.

---

## 📊 Overview

- **Two Primary Pathways**: Institutional (McNair) + Intersectional (identity-based)
- **Coverage**: Undergraduate through early faculty
- **Funding Range**: $1,000 - $50,000+
- **McNair Programs**: 200+ institutions nationwide, federally funded
- **Key Insight**: FGLI is often a criterion in broader diversity programs, not standalone

## 💡 Application Strategy: Embrace Intersectionality

### The FGLI Paradox

Unlike other diversity categories, **standalone FGLI funding is rare**. Most support comes through:
1. **Institutional programs** (McNair)
2. **Intersectional programs** (FGLI + another identity)
3. **Criteria in broader diversity programs** (Ford, NSF GRFP)

### Recommended Approach

**For Undergraduates:**
1. **Join your campus McNair Program** (if available) - this is your best bet
2. If no McNair, look for TRIO programs (Upward Bound, Student Support Services)
3. Apply to intersectional scholarships that include FGLI (Point Access if LGBTQ+)

**For Graduate Students:**
1. **Ford Foundation Fellowships** are THE flagship opportunity for FGLI scholars
   - Predoctoral: Apply during first 3 years of PhD
   - Dissertation: Apply when ABD (All But Dissertation)
2. Check if your institution offers McNair Scholar benefits
3. Apply to field-specific diversity programs that value FGLI (GFSD for STEM)

**For Postdocs:**
1. **Ford Postdoctoral Fellowship** ($50,000)
2. **RWJF New Connections** if in health fields ($50,000)
3. Look for "diversity" postdoc programs that explicitly list FGLI

**For Researchers:**
1. If studying inequality, apply to **W.T. Grant Foundation**
2. Highlight lived experience in NSF CAREER and other grants

### Highlighting FGLI Status

**In applications, emphasize:**
- Barriers overcome (not just hardship)
- How your background informs your research/career goals
- Commitment to increasing access for others
- Leadership in FGLI communities

**Common mistake**: Treating FGLI as a checkbox. Successful applications show how first-gen/low-income background shapes perspective, research, and mission.

## 🌟 Key Organizations & Programs

### McNair Scholars Program
The federal government's primary vehicle for supporting FGLI students' pathways to PhDs. If your institution has McNair, **join it**. If it doesn't, transfer to one that does (seriously considered by many FGLI students).

### Ford Foundation Fellowship Program
Most prestigious diversity fellowship in the U.S. Explicitly values first-generation and low-income backgrounds. Three-stage support (predoc, dissertation, postdoc).

### TRIO Programs
McNair is part of the larger TRIO suite of federal programs for FGLI students:
- Upward Bound (high school)
- Talent Search (middle/high school)
- Student Support Services (undergrad)
- McNair (undergrad → grad)
- Educational Opportunity Centers (adult learners)
