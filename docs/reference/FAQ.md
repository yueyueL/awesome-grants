### How current is the data?

- **Live-scraped grants**: Updated automatically when you run the scraper (see [How to Use](./how-to-use.md))
- **Curated grants**: Manually maintained and verified periodically
- Check the [Live Dashboard](./live-dashboard.md) to see when data was last collected

### Is this list complete?

No funding database is ever complete. This is a community-maintained resource focused on major, well-established funding opportunities. We prioritize:
- ✅ Regular, recurring grant programs
- ✅ Large funding amounts or high-prestige awards
- ✅ Programs accessible to international or diverse applicants
- ❌ One-time or discontinued programs
- ❌ Highly specialized niche grants (unless particularly significant)

- **EU**: ERC Starting Grants, Marie Curie Fellowships
- **UK**: Wellcome Trust Career Development Awards
- **Global**: Human Frontier Science Program

### I'm starting as faculty. What should I apply for?

**Quick path:**
1. Go to [By Audience → Faculty & PI](../audience/faculty/README.md)
2. Focus on early-career faculty awards

**Top recommendations:**
- **US**: NSF CAREER, NIH R01/R21, Sloan Fellowships

- **UK**: UKRI Future Leaders Fellowships

### I maintain an open-source project. Are there grants for me?

**Yes!** Go to [By Type → OSS Grants](../types/README.md#oss-grants) or [By Audience → OSS Maintainers](../audience/oss/README.md)

**Top recommendations:**

## Eligibility Questions

### I'm not a US citizen. Can I apply for NSF/NIH grants?

**NSF**: Most fellowships (like GRFP) require US citizenship or permanent residency. However, NSF research grants to institutions can support international researchers.

**NIH**: Similar restrictions for individual fellowships (F-series, K-series). R-series grants can support international researchers at US institutions.

**Workaround**: Join a US institution as a researcher - your PI can include you on grants.

### I'm not in Europe. Can I apply for ERC grants?

**ERC grants** are not restricted by nationality but by **where you conduct research**. You must:
- Conduct research at an institution in an EU member state or associated country
- Have your host institution endorse your application

International researchers can absolutely win ERC grants if based in Europe.

### Can I hold multiple grants simultaneously?

**It depends:**
- ✅ **Usually YES**: Combining grants from different agencies (e.g., NSF + NIH)
- ⚠️ **Check rules**: Some fellowships prohibit dual support
- ⚠️ **Report overlaps**: Always disclose other funding in "Current & Pending Support"
- ❌ **Budget overlap**: Cannot charge the same work to two grants

**Best practice**: Read each grant's terms carefully and consult your institution's sponsored research office.

### What if I'm between career stages?

Many grants have flexible eligibility windows:
- **Years since PhD**: Count career breaks (parental leave, illness, etc.) when determining eligibility
- **Transitioning roles**: Some grants (like K99/R00) are designed for transitions
- **Career changes**: Industry → Academia or Academia → Industry often have special programs

---

## Application Process

### How far in advance should I start?

**Minimum timeline:**
- **Fellowships**: 3-6 months before deadline
- **Research grants**: 6-12 months before deadline
- **Large collaborative grants**: 12-18 months before deadline

**Why start early?**
- Develop research plan
- Get collaborator commitments
- Obtain letters of recommendation
- Institutional review/approval
- Budget preparation

### Do I need preliminary data?

**Depends on the grant:**
- ✅ **Usually required**: NIH R01, large foundation grants
- ❌ **Not required**: NSF (though helpful), early-career fellowships, some EU grants
- 🤷 **Varies**: Read the solicitation carefully

**For early-career grants**: Preliminary data is less critical - focus on strong research plan and training environment.

### How important are letters of recommendation?

**Very important** for fellowships, less so for research grants.

**Tips:**
- Give recommenders 4-6 weeks notice
- Provide your CV, research statement, and grant summary
- Choose recommenders who know your work well
- Diversity matters: not all from same institution

### Can I resubmit if rejected?

**Usually yes**, and resubmissions have higher success rates!

**Best practices:**
- Read reviews carefully
- Address every criticism
- Many agencies allow revision summaries
- Some grants have specific resubmission tracks

**Success rates:**
- NIH: ~20% for new R01s, ~30% for resubmissions
- NSF: Similar patterns across programs

## Strategic Questions

### What are realistic success rates?

**Highly selective (1-5%):**
- Hertz Fellowship
- Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowships
- ERC Advanced Grants

**Very competitive (10-20%):**
- NSF GRFP (~15%)
- NIH F31 (~10-15%)
- NSF CAREER (~20-25%)
- ERC Starting Grants (~13%)

**Competitive (20-40%):**
- NIH R01 (~20%)
- Many foundation grants (20-30%)

**Strategy**: Apply to multiple grants, not just one. Successful researchers often have 5-10 active applications.

### Should I apply even if I'm not sure I'm eligible?

**If genuinely unsure**: Contact the program officer! They're there to help.

**Red flags to avoid:**
- Clear citizenship requirements
- Required institutional types
- Mandatory career stage windows

**Gray areas worth trying:**
- Interdisciplinary fit
- Borderline career stage
- Novel research approaches

### How do I improve my chances?

**Before writing:**
- ✅ Read funded abstracts (many agencies publish these)
- ✅ Attend grant-writing workshops
- ✅ Find mentors who've won the grant
- ✅ Start with smaller grants to build track record

**While writing:**
- ✅ Follow instructions exactly
- ✅ Get multiple reviewers (peers, mentors, non-experts)
- ✅ Emphasize broader impacts/significance
- ✅ Make it easy to read: clear structure, figures, summaries

**Strategic:**
- ✅ Build collaborations
- ✅ Publish and present your work
- ✅ Engage with program officers
- ✅ Apply multiple times

## Technical Questions

### How do I update the live grants data?

Run the scraper to get fresh data:

```bash
cd src/
python master_scraper.py
```

This will collect the latest opportunities from Grants.gov and NSF. See [How to Use](./how-to-use.md#updating-data) for details.

### Can I contribute new grants to the curated list?

Yes! We welcome contributions. To add a grant:

1. Check it's not already listed
2. Gather complete information (amount, deadline, eligibility, URL)
3. Either update the relevant Markdown page in `docs/` **or** extend one of the scrapers in `src/` (see README for details)
4. Run `python3 src/master_scraper.py` / `python3 src/enhanced_wiki_generator.py` if you touched the scrapers
5. Submit a pull request with the updated files

See the [main README](../README.md#contributing) for full contribution guidelines.

### Why are some grants missing deadlines?

**Live-scraped grants**: Sometimes APIs don't include deadline info, or grants have rolling deadlines

**Curated grants**: We indicate "Rolling" or "See website" when deadlines vary

**Always verify** deadlines on the official grant website - they can change!

### How do I search within the documentation?

**On GitHub:**
- Use GitHub's search: `repo:yueyuel/awesome-grants [search term]`
- Or press `/` and search within the repository

**Locally:**
- Use `grep` or your code editor's search
- Search within individual files in `docs/`

**By category:**
- Use our organized pages: [By Organization](../organizations/README.md), [By Region](../regions/README.md), etc.
